# flutterfire-ChatApp
I have been learning flutter for a while via course, so with that knowledge I tried building a basic Chat App using FLUTTER &amp; FIREBASE (SDKs &amp; CLI),
I have used all the required firebase packages.
I have also used image picker for image upload.
This App can also use mobile hardware systems like camera etc.
